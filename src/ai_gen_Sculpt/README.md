# AI-Assisted Floating Zen Garden

This is a Decentraland SDK 7 scene featuring a serene floating zen garden, created with the assistance of an AI, to demonstrate the power of collaborative creation.

## Features

-   **AI-Driven Design**: The entire scene was designed and coded with the help of an AI assistant, showcasing a new paradigm in game and experience development.
-   **Dynamic Scenery**: A large circular platform with a tall, elegant tree at its center.
-   **Animated Platforms**: 20 spherical platforms that gracefully spiral up around the central tree, with their colors changing over time.
-   **Interactive Crystal**: A glowing, clickable crystal that allows you to toggle the rotation direction of the orbiting platforms.
-   **Lightning Effects**: The central tree's leaves are the source of mesmerizing lightning bolts that connect to the moving platforms.
-   **Pulsing Lights**: The ground and the leaves of the tree have a subtle pulsing light effect, adding to the serene atmosphere.

## Getting Started

To run this scene in Decentraland, you need to have the Decentraland SDK installed.

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the scene locally**:
    ```bash
    dcl start
    ```
    This will open the scene in your browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Build Guide

To build the scene for deployment or to check for compilation errors, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript and performs type checking.

## A New Era of Creation

This project is a testament to the power of human-AI collaboration. The AI assistant was instrumental in:
-   **Conceptualization and Design**: Helping to flesh out the initial idea and suggesting features.
-   **Code Generation**: Writing the entire TypeScript code for the scene, including complex animations and interactions.
-   **Iteration and Refinement**: Quickly iterating on the design based on user feedback, making changes to the scene in real-time.

This new workflow allows for rapid prototyping and development, enabling creators to bring their visions to life faster than ever before.
